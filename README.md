Contact Manager is a simple Java application that allows users to manage their contact information directly from the console. Users can add, view, edit, and delete contacts. Each contact includes a name, phone number, and email address. The program supports persistent storage by saving contact data to a file, so your contacts are available even after restarting the program.

Features include:

Add new contacts with name, phone number, and email

Display a list of all saved contacts

Edit details of existing contacts

Delete contacts by name or index

Store contacts in a file for persistent data management

This project is ideal for Java beginners looking to practice file I/O, object-oriented programming, and basic menu-driven console applications.
